Scoreboard delays and mishaps revolving around timekeeper reaction time and miscommunication between officials have long plagued professional sports. These mistakes not only affect games, but can have multimillion-dollar ramifications. 

We estimate it takes 0.6 to 0.8 seconds for a timekeeper to react to a whistle and manually stop the game clock. Considering an average of 40 whistle blows per hockey game, that’s approximately 25 unaccounted seconds. These lost seconds are invaluable and could have multi-million dollar impacts on massive sports organizations.

Our group developed a unique solution to this problem: 

As soon as the referee blows the whistle, our device reads and analyzes the output frequency and stops the clock; this all takes place in a matter of milliseconds (yes, it’s that fast). We’ve also created a manual control web application for the referee as a backstop.

The system isn’t designed to take the human element out of officiating. Instead, we allow professional referees control and precision.
